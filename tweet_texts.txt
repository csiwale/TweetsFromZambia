Waiting is much easier than having nothing to wait for.
I used to believe that prayer changes things, but now I know that prayer changes us and we change things.
Life is all about learning from yesterday, living for today, and hoping for tomorrow.
In this world, anyone can copy your 'CREATIONS' But no one can copy your 'TALENT' Your attitude is your identity..
What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything.

If 5 seconds of a smile make a photograph more beautiful then just imagine, if you keep always smiling, how beautiful your life will be..:)
Always give without remembering &amp; always receive without forgetting.
You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.
Worrying doesn't take away tomorrow's problems, it takes away today's peace.
As long as you have hope, anything can happen.

@luchi7 &amp; @roxyjonesk chilangamulilo is simply showing the grooms family that these are the types of food we eat.
'A man of knowledge uses words with restraint, and a man of understanding is even-tempered. -Proverbs 17:27'
How are you?
'Look at your problems as problems &amp; they'll continue to hold you down. See them as blessings in disguise &amp; that's what they truly become.'
@luchi7 u are right, I had chilangamulilo myself and depending on how I keep my wife will have matebeto.
@luchi7 because matebeto can be even 2 to 3 years after you get married.

@TamTamsWorld @ZulaQi why alcohol?
I have long since forgotten the original reason why I don't drink alcohol. no one really believes that I've never ever drank before.
apparently non drinkers are into women and sex been told that by many a womanizing drunk,made me wonder how they ignore drunken philanderers
correction, have been told that by many a lady, and many a drunken womanizer. the world just doesn't trust non drinkers
@TamTamsWorld @ZulaQi what did you recommend? absinthe should do the trick
Don't be scared of the future regardless of what lies ahead. Be ready for anything. Stay strong &amp; never let fear enter your heart.

Before the White Man and Arabs, Africa was not the Utopia people wish to believe it was. They took advantage of what they found
The folks in Asia also had it bad with colonialists, and the 2nd world war brutalized them too.

our fight is a noble fight, but we must never forget that others too fight our fight in distant lands
the Europeans did trade themselves as slaves, sadly they'd stopped the time Africa was discovered, and ended up trading African slaves
the 2nd world war, was based on Hitlers belief that some Europeans were more superior than others.  he went after other Europeans

the Europeans and Arabs just came with superior firepower, which they sold to already warring parties.

@Chilaz10 which players did Moyes want? Fabregas? Herrera? So its Woodward en nt Glazers. No manager hs come out sayn funds are nt available
Maize is an imported food, brought in by European colonizers. Nshima is therefore not possibly a traditional food
@Chilaz10 and that tree cost 26 m. Moyes asked for that tree. Not the Glazers. Glazers are responsible for making funds available
@Ms_Frantrele so you don't do Starbucks?
I just don't know whether those 2 niggas rolling with David Livingstone were slaves, volunteers or workers. very vague on that one
@Chilaz10 so if the manager hasn't come out saying that, then wr do you get The info?
Its been this way for so long#insideout# #fb
@Chilaz10 you and I both know Fergie was not about that. I.e buying expensive. Those typa players come with ego's. Fergie was not about that

One word? http://t.co/4yXnRtOguz
Friends will come, friends will go but God will never leave you! Money will come, money will go but God will never leave you!
What do u treasure the most in your life?
Don't depress yourself with thoughts of what tomorrow may bring; don't worry about tomorrow; live your life today
Thoughts are also a pathway of sin!!! Control the mind and you would have defeated on element that causes sin!
We sin in so many ways but hey; 85% of the sin we commit is by choice!! Don't blame the devil for your wrongs, take the blame!
If you say you are not a sin, then you are saying that the word in the bible is lying.
There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
Did you know that suicide is sin??
Judge not and you shall not be judged; forgive and you shall be forgive; do not condemn and you will not be condemned!
I rebuke negativity,positive energy all the way.....God really answers prayers,his a Living God...

alot of folk don't know the simple basic truth, Prayer without any action to achieve prayed for goal is meaningless.
som3 folks pray the whole day for days on end.
so while they praying, I have no idea whom they expect to act to achieve what they pray for
some pray for an end to war and help for refugees. 
they pray days and night for that, never bothering to actually help a refugee

@CLusaka @wantemwa I have been dreaming to see Bruce,  Rodrick and #SateSate play decisive roles in todays match @zambianfootball #Chipolopolo
Beatmakers are mostly "Single-genre" specialists. E.g they only make Trap, or Hiphop.
Most Beatmakers don't have technical knowledge about sound.
Beatmakers don't know how to use Outboard gear.
@DowJones #I'm a journalist based in Zambia, Southern Africa. I would like apply for the advertised job of Desk Editor in India. Can I?:
Beatmakers can't play any other instrument apart from a computer mouse.

if road to hell is paved with good intentions, what is the road to heaven paved with?
if good intentions get me damned, WTF'll get me saved?
I see "righteous" men do bad things daily, what hope is there for a lost soul like me?
we can do it in the kitchen, in the bathroom, on the ceiling, on the floor!

in other words we can do it anywhere
@SiphoBl0se u may have a point. 
smiling thru pain only comforts those around u, whilst u waste away inside.
never thought of it like that

I feel like as Zambians we need to understand the music we do. What is R&amp;B? Are you sure your music is R&amp;B? Can we please be serious!
There is a gross lack of education in our industry. FYI when you take that music where people are educated, its not R&amp;B. Learn and grow.
@zuluzulujr I am just gonna say that R&amp;B as a pure genre does not exist in this country. We have our own music that needs its own name.
R&amp;B is Rhythm &amp; Blues. And nobody is singing anything blues influenced here except Viola and Kiki. So please...learn and grow.
no one knows if they have fewer or more tomorrows than their yesterdays, so make the best of your todays
@KalushaPBwalya @CLusaka I am impressed with Norwegian Coach's decision to play 15yr old Martin Odegaard in there last Euro Qualifier.
Now I want 2 big fat corn rolls(corn rows) cause this heat is not sexy! Cc : @leelabee

@zuluzulujr not saying there isn't a single R&amp;B Zambian song. One person who does it well is Salma. But in general? People must sit down.
@zuluzulujr that same dunka music needs a name. Is it afro beat or is it whatever? It needs a name. Lets not lie and call it R&amp;B.

@caesarcognac lol...look at you! MJ's genius has influenced the same people you think are great today. Overrated is the wrong word.
@caesarcognac no it doesn't. However, in this instance you cannot compare CB artistically, vocally or as a performer to MJ. Its absurd.
@caesarcognac have you heard CB singing during a performance? Just in terms of vocal technique. 1/2
@caesarcognac leave out the fact that CB can't sing and dance at the same time. Something that MJ made into an art.
As it stands...GODZILA 9 VOTES ; HERCULES 6 VOTES ; 22 JUMP STREET 5 VOTES; NOAH 2 VOTES...Voting ends this Friday http://t.co/V7aBZm8EkV
@caesarcognac if you talk about hits,for his time yes CB is the king of the catchy hook but that's for his time.MJ is relevant for all time.
@caesarcognac MJ impacted singers, dancers, arrangers, he impacted music video history, he impacted the meaning of pop. CB can't compare.
@caesarcognac CB can't even adlib on key into the mic when he's on stage. I'm a singer. I know what that is. Let's just be realistic.
@caesarcognac next you will say everyone from that generation is overrated. But you forget that the new school is here because of them.
@caesarcognac say to you. Yes. To you. But overrated and MJ don't go together and they shouldn't. To anyone.

@Enyboo @JackpoTT_Creata Wait I think I'm confused. How much is a logo of the appropriate "quality" supposed to cost???
That @sebastiendutch @DJLBCZambia djlbcand @slapdee slapsong. That song. Whoop!
@bernchama @ZambianKICKOFF @chipolopolodh It was wrong to start Chisamba on the bench and Jacob should not be called next time
@AlKameo yeah @JackpoTT_Creata could have done a way better job. Even @mfumu3D and a whole stack of other people. But we know the drill.
@JackpoTT_Creata @Enyboo I mean. Really?
@Enyboo @JackpoTT_Creata that's what happens when the wrong people are in charge of things.
@applechews @Enyboo oh no. The logo is weak. I was actually js rting it coz its a ridiculous statement.
@applechews loooooooooolllll that was me yesterday!

"@MP_Crunch: Finally Bruce Musakanya starts.... Sigh*" The boy is brilliant
@applechews @Enyboo no no no, I like nice things. That logo looks like we're stuck in a 1964 time warp and boiling in a copper pot. Ghastly.
So that @DJLBCZambia @sebastiendutch @slapdee song. That song. Today. Yes. Whoop!

folks nowadays are more scared of pregnancy, than they are of STDs and HIV.
misinformation and ignorance I think
Herpes and HIV/AIDS are lifelong ailments, if u can avoid them do avoid them, if you got them don't spread them
#KamangaWear im in love. So god to have the awesome @Kareen_Durand  on my team.  #excited #wekeepmoving
condoms prevent more than just pregnancy, use em wisely and the time u no longer need 2 use them u'll be much the better for having used em
@FixedOpsGenius @awakeningaimee @saferdates Honesty in everything
Syphilis can mess up your internal organs before killing you.
yet its curable.
some folks don't go for treatment for fear of embarrassment
we live in very enlightened times, with information flowing freely and yet many many folks would rather stay ignorant
science doesn't weaken your faith, your lack of faith causes the weakness which the science exposes.
many scientists are religious men

maybe they'll nuke Ebola into submission

TURN THE BEAT UP - By @lizwemanjakazi #NOW PLAYING ON @QfmZambia #AfternoonDrive
"0 to 100, real quick"
Everybody wants you to be ready for kids, because they're ready for you to have kids
Family always seems to think that you're just going to buckle and give in to what they want for you
When most of your friends are broody and wanting to get pregnant and you're just not about that life. Clearly I'm weird
I think once you've been in a relationship where you've given up so many things for your partner and you decide to move on
You are very wary of doing that with the next person you date
Its pretty interesting to think that you do get to a point where a relationship isn't your be all and end all, and you want more from life
The things I'm able to accomplish when I surround myself with positive minded people.
You want to achieve certain things, before you tie yourself down
Let's continue building each other.
I don't really think that being financial secure is the only thing to take into consideration when thinking about starting a family.NO.
And I think that's just because I feel that emotion becomes an integral part of raising kids.
And then you date a guy that is more than ready and you just start thinking about everything. so much pressure.

Question to the free thinkers: do you ever feel like every day conversation would be easier if you thought like most people?
@Afriquin13 yeys it's allowed,I don't know why it took you this long to be selfish on me..But oh well..
if you really like someone in that way, and you declare your feelings to them, there's no way you're going to be friends ..
Some men think everything to do with the friendzone for women is about ego, is that b/c having hot friends for you is an ego boost, or?...
The friend zone is not a prison, you guys just make it seem like it is
Telling someone that no quality individual will accept them with baggage is a lie.
A person who really wants to be with you will accept your baggage and try make it work
We've been told that baggage is a bad thing, those are your experiences, they shaped you into the person that they like enough to wanna date
On the submission thing, if you date a man who you feel fulfills his role, you won't argue over the submission thing, it'll come naturally
"A woman will submit to a righteous man"
And there's nothing wrong with a woman feeling like submission is "slavery", she obviously hasn't met a man who showed her otherwise.

I won't sacrifice myself just to appease your patriarchal sensibilities. Don't claim to fight for me when you won't even acknowledge me.
Know when you have enough friends. This is vital. You don't need 10 friends. Nurture the relationships of the few real friends you have.
