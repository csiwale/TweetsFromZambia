Waiting
is
much
easier
than
having
nothing
to
wait
for.
I
used
to
believe
that
prayer
changes
things,
but
now
I
know
that
prayer
changes
us
and
we
change
things.
Life
is
all
about
learning
from
yesterday,
living
for
today,
and
hoping
for
tomorrow.
In
this
world,
anyone
can
copy
your
'CREATIONS'
But
no
one
can
copy
your
'TALENT'
Your
attitude
is
your
identity..
What
would
life
be
if
we
had
no
courage
to
attempt
anything.

If
5
seconds
of
a
smile
make
a
photograph
more
beautiful
then
just
imagine,
if
you
keep
always
smiling,
how
beautiful
your
life
will
be..:)
Always
give
without
remembering
&amp;
always
receive
without
forgetting.
You
can't
start
the
next
chapter
of
your
life
if
you
keep
re-reading
the
last
one.
Worrying
doesn't
take
away
tomorrow's
problems,
it
takes
away
today's
peace.
As
long
as
you
have
hope,
anything
can
happen.

Time

matebeto
is
when

@luchi7

@roxyjonesk
chilangamulilo
is
simply
showing
the

family
that
these
are
the
types
of
food
we
eat.

'Look

&amp;
they'll

to
hold
you
down.
See
them
as
blessings
in

&amp;
that's
what
they
truly
become.'
@luchi7
u
are
right,
I
had
chilangamulilo
myself
and
depending
on
how
I
keep
my
wife
will
have
matebeto.
@luchi7
because
matebeto
can
be
even
2
to
3
years
after
you
get
married.
Happiness
is
not

on

why
alcohol?
I
have
long

forgotten
the
original
reason
why
I
don't
drink
alcohol.
no
one
really
believes
that
I've
never
ever
drank
before.
apparently
non
drinkers
are
into
women
and
sex
been
told
that
by
many
a
womanizing
drunk,made
me
wonder
how
they
ignore

philanderers
correction,
have
been
told
that
by
many
a

and
many
a

just

the

that
the
missionaries
obtained,
were
used
by

to
conquer
Africa.
the
Missionary
Position
was
and
is
not
saintly
position,
but
is
one
of
few
positions
the

could
do.
the

just
came
with

they
